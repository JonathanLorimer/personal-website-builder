## Introduction

  In this review I am going to discuss 3 topics. The first is what I wanted to get out of this text and why I was interested in reading it in the first place. The second is the actual structure and workflow of a zettelkasten as recommended by the book. The last topic are the concepts that I found interesting, and the ones that I struggled with.

## My Goals

  In University I studied philosophy, and I remember reviewing the department wide rubric for grading papers. I recall being a bit miffed about the criterion for an `A` grade. I don't recollect the exact wording, but it was something to the tune of "all A papers must contain original thought". How does one, an undergraduate nonetheless, come up with original thought in a discipline that is over 2 millennia old? The solution I came up with, though my A papers were few and far between, was concept synthesis. I could just take the ideas of two or more other philosophers, smash them together (compare and contrast, etc.), et voilà an original thought. I had a professor, who in her first class, made it clear that she would punish any transgressions against academic integrity to the full extent of the power accorded to her. Coincidentally she ended up being one of my favourite professors. The combination of a strategy that relied heavily on the work of others, and a very threating philosophy of law professor forced me to establish a meticulous set of literature notes and corresponding citation information. This was my first taste of a note taking system.

  I have to say, with this primitive note taking system, I realized a lot of the benefits espoused by the zettelkasten crowd; papers seemingly wrote themselves, bibliographies (which were previously a pain) had finished themselves by the end of the paper, and I could effectively separate the note taking, thinking, and writing steps. My papers and grades benefited immediately.

  The note taking system consisted of several directories separated by course and topic. Additionally I had reading notes and class notes. All of this was done within One Note. There were several shortcomings: global search by word was a slow workflow as words are often reused (with vastly different meanings) in different areas of philosophy, searching by topics that spanned multiple courses (i.e. ethics) was very difficult and tagging notes in in One Note was clumsy, if I had a specific note in mind it was very difficult to find across all of my literature notes. After University I largely gave up on my note taking system. Recently, I happened across a discussion about the zettelkasten system in the functional programming Zulip chat. It seemed to answer all the pain points that I had previously felt, and succinctly elucidated why my note system had provided value and also the ways in which it was flawed. Someone in the chat forum I was reading mentioned _How to Take Smart Notes_ and I ordered it.

My goals for this book were to:
- Firmly understand the structure of the system and how to use it, for some reason I found this methodology difficult to grasp even after reading a dozen or so articles
- More accurately understand the benefits of the system
- Understand the system so well that I could tailor it to my own note taking predilections

## Structure and Workflow

  The zettelkasten takes a minimalist approach to creating what some call an [external brain](https://gettingthingsdone.com/2018/07/are-you-out-of-your-mind/). There are several key structures that are critical to implementing a zettelkasten. Additionally, I think there are several concepts that go along with these structures that make it much easier to understand. We will start with the structures. Here is a directory structure that reflects the conceptual structure of the zettelkasten.

zettelkasten/
├── slip-box/
│   ├── index
│   ├── note-1
│   ├── note-2
│   └── ...
└── literature-notes/
    ├── ahrens_how-to-take-smart-notes/
    │   ├── note-1
    │   ├── note-2
    │   └── note-3
    └── ...

  The first key structural distinction is between the `slip-box` and the `literature-notes`. The slip box is meant to be a contiguous chain of notes that are roughly sorted by topic. The sorting occurs as one adds notes to the slip-box. Slip-box notes are created to signify a meaningful idea that relates to the areas of study that you are interested in, and the notes are added behind other notes that relate to the same area. The literature notes act as a reference management system, and keep track of important information in a text (the notes should contain a page number or some such identifier). Now the literature notes are supposed to help us derive slip box notes; once we are finished reading a resource we should try and generate notes for the slip-box.
