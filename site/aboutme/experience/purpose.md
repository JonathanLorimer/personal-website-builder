- Aside from regular development tickets I took the initiative to single handedly re-write the front end, feature for feature, in under a month. I moved from EJS/Jquery/Vanilla JS (~60,000 LOC) to Vue.js/Parcel/Babel (~5000 LOC), saving the company ~$2,475,000 in long term bug maintenance and down-time.
- Automated pdf population for crucial KYC and onboarding forms, saving money on manual processing and allowing the company to scale and go to market faster.
