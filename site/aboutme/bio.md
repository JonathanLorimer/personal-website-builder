I am a software developer who is passionate about functional programming. I have a background in Philosophy, but recently have been interested in Type Systems, Algebraic Structures, and Category Theory. I run the Toronto Haskell Meetup, which is aimed at helping beginners get up to speed, and I run the Toronto Haskell User Group for more advanced participants. I enjoy using domain modeling through types and algebraic abstractions to reason about a problem space and derive a correct implementation.
