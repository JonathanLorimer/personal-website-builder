I am a software developer based in Toronto who is passionate about functional programming, particularly Haskell. I did my undergraduate degree in Philosophy focusing on epistemology, philosophy of law, and ethics. Recently I have been interested in Type Systems, Algebraic Structures, and Category Theory. I run the [Toronto Haskell Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-evRITRtT), which is aimed at growing the statically typed, ML based, functional programming community locally. In my spare time I am usually trying to learn more about the beautiful structures and techniques that abound in the Haskell ecosystem. When I am not programming I love to mentor and to learn from others, I used to play rugby but have found that I prefer squash these days.
